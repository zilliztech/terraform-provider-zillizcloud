# zillizcloud_cluster_load_balancer_security_groups (Resource)

Manages the load balancer security groups for a Zilliz Cloud cluster.

This resource allows you to associate security groups with the load balancer of a specific cluster. This provides network-level security control for cluster access.

Typical use case: Configure network access controls and security boundaries for cluster load balancers in cloud environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zillizcloud = {
      source = "zilliztech/zillizcloud"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Zilliz Cloud provider
provider "zillizcloud" {
}

# Fetch project information
data "zillizcloud_project" "default" {
  # Replace with your actual byoc project ID
  # id = "proj-example123456789"
}

# Create a cluster in byoc project
resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_name = "example-cluster"
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id
  cu_size      = 1
  cu_type      = "Performance-optimized"
}

# Associate security groups with the cluster's load balancer
resource "zillizcloud_cluster_load_balancer_security_groups" "example" {
  cluster_id = zillizcloud_cluster.example.id

  security_group_ids = [
    "sg-0123456789abcdef0", # Replace with your actual security group ID
  ]
}

# Output the cluster connection details
output "cluster_endpoint" {
  description = "The cluster connection endpoint"
  value       = zillizcloud_cluster.example.connect_address
}

output "security_groups" {
  description = "The security groups associated with the cluster load balancer"
  value       = zillizcloud_cluster_load_balancer_security_groups.example.security_group_ids
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_id` (String) The ID of the cluster to associate security groups with.

You can obtain this value from the output of the `zillizcloud_cluster` resource, for example:
`zillizcloud_cluster.example.id`

**Example:**
`in01-1234567890abcdef`

> **Note:** Changing this value will force recreation of the resource.
- `security_group_ids` (Set of String) A set of security group IDs to associate with the load balancer of the cluster.

**Example:**
`["sg-1234567890abcdef0"]`

> **Note:** The security groups must exist in the same VPC as the cluster and be accessible to the Zilliz Cloud service.
