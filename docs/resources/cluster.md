# zillizcloud_cluster (Resource)

Cluster resource. If 'plan', 'cu_size' and 'cu_type' are not specified, then a free cluster is created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zillizcloud = {
      source = "zilliztech/zillizcloud"
    }
  }
}

provider "zillizcloud" {
}

data "zillizcloud_project" "default" {
  # Fetching the default project information to be used in cluster provisioning
}

resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "free_plan_cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-01"                        # The name of the cluster
  plan         = "Free"                              # The service plan for the cluster The name of the cluster
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}

resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "serverless_plan_cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-02"                        # The name of the cluster
  plan         = "Serverless"                        # The service plan for the cluster# The name of the cluster
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}


resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "standard_plan_cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-03"                        # The name of the cluster
  region_id    = "aws-us-east-2"                     # The region where the cluster will be deployed

  cu_size      = 1                                   # The size of the compute unit
  cu_type      = "Performance-optimized"             # The type of compute unit, optimized for performance
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}

  region_id    = "aws-us-east-2"                     # The region where the cluster will be deployed
  plan         = "Enterprise"                        # The service plan for the cluster
  cu_size      = 1                                   # The size of the compute unit
  cu_type      = "Performance-optimized"             # The type of compute unit, optimized for performance
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_name` (String) The name of the cluster to be created. It is a string of no more than 32 characters.
- `project_id` (String) The ID of the project where the cluster is to be created.

### Optional

- `cu_size` (Number) The size of the CU to be used for the created cluster. It is an integer from 1 to 256.
- `cu_type` (String) The type of the CU used for the Zilliz Cloud cluster to be created. A compute unit (CU) is the physical resource unit for cluster deployment. Different CU types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, and storage. Available options are Performance-optimized, Capacity-optimized, and Extended-capacity.
- `desired_status` (String) The desired status of the cluster. Possible values are RUNNING and SUSPENDED. Defaults to RUNNING.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of labels to assign to the cluster. Labels are key-value pairs that can be used to organize and categorize clusters.
- `load_balancer_security_groups` (Set of String, Deprecated) A set of security group IDs to associate with the load balancer of the cluster.
- `plan` (String) The plan tier of the Zilliz Cloud service. Available options are Serverless, Standard and Enterprise.
- `region_id` (String) The ID of the region where the cluster exists.
- `replica` (Number) The number of replicas for the cluster. Defaults to 1.
- `status` (String) The current status of the cluster. Possible values are RUNNING, SUSPENDING, SUSPENDED, and RESUMING.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `connect_address` (String) The public endpoint of the cluster. You can connect to the cluster using this endpoint from the public network.
- `create_time` (String) The time at which the cluster has been created.
- `description` (String) An optional description about the cluster.
- `id` (String) Cluster identifier
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password of the cluster user generated by default. It will not be displayed again, so note it down and securely store it.
- `private_link_address` (String) The private endpoint of the cluster. You can set up a private link to allow your VPS in the same cloud region to access your cluster.
- `prompt` (String) The statement indicating that this operation succeeds.
- `username` (String) The name of the cluster user generated by default.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) Timeout defaults to 45 mins. Accepts a string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `update` (String) Timeout defaults to 30 mins. Accepts a string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
