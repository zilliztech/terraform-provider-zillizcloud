# Tutorial: Creating Zilliz a Starter Cloud Cluster Resources with Terraform

This tutorial guides you through managing Zilliz Cloud clusters using the `zillizcloud_cluster` resource within Terraform. You'll learn how to:

- Retrieve project and region IDs for cluster creation.
- Define clusters with various configurations in Terraform.
- Plan and apply changes to provision clusters in Zilliz Cloud.
- Verify the creation of your Zilliz Cloud clusters.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have completed the initial setup steps outlined in the [Getting Started with Zilliz Cloud Terraform Provider](./get-start.md) guide. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access credentials to interact with the Zilliz Cloud API.


### Creating a Cluster

With the `project ID` at hand, creating Zilliz Cloud clusters is straightforward. Below is an illustrative example defining zillizcloud_cluster resources within Terraform configuration:


```hcl

data "zillizcloud_project" "default" {}

resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "starter_cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-01"
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id 
}

```
This example will create two Zilliz Cloud clusters:
- **Starter Cluster**: This configuration creates a basic cluster named "Cluster-01" within the default project. It's suitable for initial testing or small-scale applications.

### Planning and Applying Changes

Once you've defined the cluster resources, it's time to apply the changes to provision the Zilliz Cloud clusters. Navigate to your Terraform project directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Note**: The `-auto-approve` flag avoids prompting for confirmation before applying the changes. Use caution, especially in production environments. It's recommended to thoroughly review the plan before applying.

Review the plan generated by Terraform and confirm to apply the changes. Terraform will orchestrate the creation of the specified clusters based on your configuration.

### Verifying Provisioned Clusters

After applying the changes, you can verify the provisioned Zilliz Cloud clusters either through the Zilliz Cloud dashboard. Ensure that the clusters are created with the desired configurations and are functioning as expected.
